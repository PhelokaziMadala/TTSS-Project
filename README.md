# TTSS-Project
# Tech Talent Scorecard System (TTSS)

## 📝 Problem Statement

At CAPACITI, the current candidate evaluation process is manual, time-consuming, and lacks a centralized system. Mentors are required to create individual scorecards, often providing feedback verbally or on separate documents. This results in:

- Delayed feedback for candidates  
- Compromised confidentiality (as candidates can sometimes view each other's performance)  
- Increased administrative burden on mentors

## ✅ Solution

The **Tech Talent Scorecard System (TTSS)** is a digital evaluation tool designed to transform how mentors and Talent Development Coordinators (TDCs) assess candidates. TTSS enables real-time score entry, instant feedback generation, and centralized candidate management — all in one platform.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Dynamic Score Entry**  
  Automatically update candidate scores in real time for accurate and immediate evaluation.

- **Auto-Generated Feedback**  
  Receive personalized, criteria-based feedback and mentor comments instantly (e.g., for attendance, tech skills, and project delivery).

- **Interactive Dashboards**  
  Visualize key performance metrics and score trends to support data-driven decisions.

- **Centralized Communication**  
  Candidates can message mentors directly if unsatisfied with their feedback, and mentors receive instant notifications for transparency and resolution.

- **User Management**  
  Easily add new groups, candidates, and mentors — all in one integrated system.
